- Build home dashboard showing daily screen time, limits, progress, streaks, and motivational quotes
- Implement Focus Mode with timers, countdown animations, early exit warnings, and completion rewards
- Create Digital Detox Challenges system with pre-built and custom challenges tracking daily progress
- Build Statistics & Analytics page with daily/weekly/monthly charts for screen time, focus hours, and improvement
- Implement rewards system with points, level progression (Beginner to Digital Master), and unlockable badges
- Create AI Smart Assistant analyzing usage patterns and providing personalized suggestions
- Build reminder system for screen time limits and nighttime disconnect notifications
