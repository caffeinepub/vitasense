  "summary": "The diff implements the core VitaSense landing/auth/dashboard/profile + health log flows and a themed UI, plus a static “Future AI Insights” page. No clear missing REQ items are provable from the provided diff summary, but several unrequested features were added (notably access control/admin token plumbing and a promotional footer link).",

    {
      "description": "Backend access control / authorization system (roles like #user/admin checks) added around profile and health log endpoints, plus an initialization method invoked from the frontend using a secret token.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest REQ-3/REQ-5 did not request authorization/roles/admin-token initialization; it only required per-principal storage and CRUD/upsert endpoints.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (imports MixinAuthorization, AccessControl; permission checks/traps in getCallerUserProfile/saveCallerUserProfile/createHealthLogEntry/getHealthLogEntries)",

      "description": "Footer includes a promotional/attribution link to caffeine.ai with referral parameters.",
      "reason": "Not requested by any REQ; user-facing content was specified around VitaSense branding and medical disclaimers, not external promotional links.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (footer: “Built with ♥ using caffeine.ai” with external link)"

      "description": "Dark-mode/system theme switching via next-themes ThemeProvider.",
      "reason": "REQ-7 asks for a coherent theme; it does not request adding next-themes or system theme switching specifically.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (imports ThemeProvider from 'next-themes' and wraps the app)"
